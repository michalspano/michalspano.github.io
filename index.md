Hello there, my name is **Michal Spano**! &#128075;

I'm a passionate Software/Website Developer and Data Analyst from Slovakia, currently based in Sweden’s Gothenburg – a Student of **Software Engineering and Management** at **Gothenburg University/Chalmers University of Technology**. Currently, my position is **IT Consultant** at [**CTK**](https://www.ctk.se/){:target="_blank"}.

> _"I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits."_ – Kent Beck.

This website is my **personal portfolio**, where I showcase my [projects](https://github.com/michalspano){:target="_blank"}, skills, and experiences. Similarly, I write about my **journey** as a developer and share my knowledge with others. Moreover, I plan to use the website to share my thoughts and ideas about the world of technology and software development via blog posts. Oh, almost forgot - I stand with the world of **Open Source**. &#127881;

Asides from the mentioned, I enjoy **graphic design**, **video editing**, and photography. View my work on [Adobe Portfolio](https://michalspano.myportfolio.com/){:target="_blank"}. My other hobbies include **reading**, **traveling**, and taking walks in nature.
