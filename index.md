This website is my **personal portfolio**, where I showcase my
projects, skills, and experiences. Similarly, I write about my **journey** as a
programmer and share my knowledge with others. I also plan to use the website
to share my thoughts and ideas about the world of technology and software
development via blog posts.

I `<3` **open source** software and [functional &lambda;][fp].

Besides, I also enjoy [**computer graphics** \& **video editing**][behance] and
[photography][flickr]. My other hobbies include reading, music, traveling, and
taking walks in nature.
