I am a passionate Computer Scientist and a (*functional*) programmer born in
Bratislava (Slovakia), presently based in Sweden's Gothenburg. I'm a student of
Computer Science (MSc.) @ Chalmers in Sweden. My interests include (but are not
limited to) linguistics, design, and teaching. At the moment I'm reading loads
on type theory.

This website is a personal showcase of (sometimes random) things. I write a
lot---academic, essays, and much else---some of which may end up here.

Previously, I've edited videos and made various [graphics][behance] and created
digital [content][youtube]; I'm also learning [photography][flickr] and music
production at this moment, albeit there's not much to highlight (yet!).
