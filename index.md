This website is my **personal portfolio**, where I showcase my [projects](https://github.com/michalspano){:target="_blank"}, skills, and experiences. Similarly, I write about my **journey** as a developer and share my knowledge with others. Moreover, I plan to use the website to share my thoughts and ideas about the world of technology and software development via blog posts. Oh, almost forgot - I stand with the world of **Open Source** and [**Functional Programming**](https://fp.michalspano.com/)! &#128640;

Asides from the mentioned, I enjoy **graphic design**, **video editing**, and [photography](https://flickr.com/photos/197352203@N08/){:target="_blank"}.
