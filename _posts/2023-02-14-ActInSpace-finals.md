\#ActInSpace **Hackathon International Finals** in Cannes, France \#ITatGU &#128640; 

w/ Ionel Pop; Mariia Zabolotnia; Agrima Singh

Having won the **National Round in Sweden**, I and my classmates recently competed in the International Finals of the ActInSpace Hackathon. &#127480;&#127466;

We'd like to thank **Openhack Sweden** for providing us with this opportunity, as well as our department of **CSE** (Computer Science and Engineering) at the [**University of Gothenburg**](https://www.gu.se/){:target="_blank"} for their continuous support; ultimately, we'd like to thank our primary sponsor, [**Sandvik**](https://www.home.sandvik/en/){:target="_blank"} - all of your help is greatly appreciated, and we're excited to share our experience with others! Finally, I'd like to thank all of our friends and classmates who have helped us with this initiative.

Additionally, I'd like to congratulate the Grand Prize-winning team from Azerbaijan, Nexus. &#127881;

To summarize, this has been a fantastic experience, and I'm looking forward to participating in similar upcoming events!
