Teaching is something that I feel very passionate about. Previously, I've been
a TA (at Gothenburg & Chalmers University) for the following courses:
Object-Oriented Programming, C & Embedded and Realtime Systems, and
Requirements Engineering. I mostly assisted with administrative tasks as well
as lab supervisions and coursework grading.

Besides, since 2021, I've been actively (*privately*) tutoring both
highschoolers and university students in mathematics, programming, and
languages! I've now delivered more than 150+ lectures across a multitude of
languages (e.g., Slovak, English, and Swedish).

Lectures in programming were focused on e.g., Python, Haskell, C, algorithms
and datastructure, and topics in mathematics typically include: algebra,
calculus, differential equations, geometry.

For more information, see my profiles on the following platforms:
* (Slovakia) [Doučma.sk][doucma]
* (Sweden) [Superprof.se][superprof]

I take tutoring inquiries gladly via email too. I attach some exemplary
material that I created for students: [(Digital) Maths exercises (highschool;
Slovak)][digital], [(Handwritten) Datastructures & Programming (University;
Slovak/English)][handwritten], [C Programming sample program
(beginner)][program_c].

I typeset material in `Markdown` (enriched with `TeX`) and use
[pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to produce print-friendly documents. I have a
[repository][repo] with (some) of the templates I use.

Hand-written material is typically from the lectures; I use [Nebo][nebo] for
writing. For programming, Google's [Collab][collab] does a decent job for
Python; for other languages, I've a minimal (distraction-, LSP-, AI-free) `Vim`
configuration where I type and present code.
