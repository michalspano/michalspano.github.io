Teaching is something that I feel very passionate about. Previosuly, I've been
a TA (at Gothenburg & Chalmers University) for the following courses:
Object-Oriented Programming, C & Embedded and Realtime Systems, and
Requirements Engineering. I mostly assisted with administrative tasks as well
as lab supervisions and coursework grading.

Besides, since 2021, I've been actively (*privately*) tutoring both
highschoolers and university students in mathematics, programming, and
languages! I've now delivered more than 150+ lectures across a multitude of
languages (e.g., Slovak, English, and Swedish).

Lectures in programming were focused on e.g., Python, Haskell, C, algorithms
and datastructure, and topics in mathematics typically include: algebra,
calculus, differential equations, geometry.

For more information, see my profiles on the following platforms:

I take tutoring inquiries gladly via email too. I attach some exemplary
material that I created for students below; feel free to check it out!
